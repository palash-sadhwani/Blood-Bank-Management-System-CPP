# 🩸 Blood Bank Management System (C++)

## 📌 About the Project
This academic project simulates a basic **Blood Bank Management System**
using **C++**. It was developed to understand **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**,
file handling, and structured program design.

The system allows registration of blood donors and recipients,
stores records in files, and provides an admin panel for viewing data.

---

## ✨ Features
- Donor registration with eligibility check
- Recipient registration and blood request
- File-based storage of donor and recipient data
- Admin panel with password protection
- View donor and recipient records
- Record count analytics

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (Inheritance & Polymorphism)
- Classes and Functions
- File Handling using `fstream`
- Input validation
- Modular programming

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** GCC / MinGW
- **Platform:** Windows (Console Application)

---

## ▶ How to Run

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o blood_bank
./blood_bank

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Replace file-based storage with database integration (MySQL / SQLite)
- Add search and filtering functionality
- Improve input validation
- Add graphical user interface (GUI)
- Encrypt sensitive user data
